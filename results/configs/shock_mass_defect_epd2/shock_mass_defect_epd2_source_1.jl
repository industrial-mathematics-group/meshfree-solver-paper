# Conservation defect as a statistic, attached by the post-processing pass of `run_all_simulations` (the configs
# of this folder list this file in `sources` and name `conservation_defect!` as `postprocess`).
#
# A regular statistic (`calc_stat`) only sees the states of one time step, so it cannot form m(t) − m(0) or the
# boundary flux; the post-processing pass has the whole run and its parameters. Stored statistics:
#   :conservation_defect        time series  (m(t) − m(0) − B(t)) / |m(t)|        (per component)
#   :final_conservation_defect  scalar       the same at t_end
#   :boundary_flux              time series  B(t), the exact net inflow through the boundary
# with m(t) = h^DS Σ_i u_i, the discrete mass of the `:mass` statistic of the hyperbolic preset (h = equivalent
# particle spacing of the data; this is the quantity the scheme conserves, not Σ V_i u_i with Shepard volumes),
# and B(t) = 0 on periodic domains, B(t) = (f(u_L) − f(u_R)) · n t for a 1-D Riemann problem with outflow
# boundaries whose waves stay inside the domain until t_end (f the flux of the run's equation). Other setups have
# no exact boundary flux: the statistics are not added (the function warns once per run).
